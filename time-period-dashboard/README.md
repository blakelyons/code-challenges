## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) - Vue 3 Framework
-   [Skeleton-Elements](https://skeleton-elements.nolimits4web.com/) - Skeleton Framework

### What I learned

I don't have a ton of experience creating and deloying Vue Apps because that infrastructure is usually already in place. I wanted to use this challenge to better familiarize myself with creating and deploying Vue 3 Apps.

### Continued development

I'm not 100% confident in the deployment process so I plan to continue to learn more about deploying Vue 3 Apps from beginning to end.

### Useful resources

I don't have any useful resources to go along with this project.
