## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
-   Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
    -   Any input field is empty
    -   The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
-   View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
-   [Icons](https://iconify.design/) - For styles
-   [SASS](https://sass-guidelin.es/) - SCSS

### What I learned

I don't have a ton of experience creating and deloying Vue Apps because that infrastructure is usually already in place. I wanted to use this challenge to better familiarize myself with creating and deploying Vue 3 Apps from start to finish.

### Continued development

I plan on continuing to practice deploying Vue deployments.
